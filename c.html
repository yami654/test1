  <h2>Hard dist</h2>
  <p>A hard disk drive (HDD), hard disk, hard drive, or fixed disk[b] is an
    electro-mechanical data storage device that stores and retrieves digital
    data using magnetic storage and one or more rigid rapidly rotating platters
    coated with magnetic material. The platters are paired with magnetic heads,
    usually arranged on a moving actuator arm, which read and write data to the
    platter surfaces.[2] Data is accessed in a random-access manner, meaning that
    individual blocks of data can be stored and retrieved in any order. HDDs are
    a type of non-volatile storage, retaining stored data even when powered off.
    Modern HDDs are typically in the form of a small rectangular box.</p>
