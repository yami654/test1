  <h2>Memory</h2>
  <p>Memory is the faculty of the brain by which data or information is encoded,
    stored, and retrieved when needed. It is the retention of information over
    time for the purpose of influencing future action.[1] If past events could
    not be remembered, it would be impossible for language, relationships,
    or personal identity to develop.[2] Memory loss is usually described as
    forgetfulness or amnesia.</p>

   <p>Memory is often understood as an informational processing system with
     explicit and implicit functioning that is made up of a sensory processor,
     short-term (or working) memory, and long-term memory.[9] This can be
     related to the neuron. The sensory processor allows information from the
     outside world to be sensed in the form of chemical and physical stimuli and
     attended to various levels of focus and intent. Working memory serves as an
     encoding and retrieval processor. Information in the form of stimuli is
      encoded in accordance with explicit or implicit functions by the working
      memory processor. The working memory also retrieves information from
      previously stored material. Finally, the function of long-term memory
      is to store data through various categorical models or systems.</p>
