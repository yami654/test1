  <h2>Module</h2>
  <p>A module is a separate unit of software or hardware. Typical characteristics
      of modular components include portability, which allows them to be used in a
      variety of systems, and interoperability, which allows them to function with
      the components of other systems. The term was first used in architecture.</p>

    <p>1) In computer programming, especially in older languages such as PL/1,
       the output of the language compiler was known as an object module to
       distinguish it from the set of source language statements, sometimes
       known as the source module. In mainframe systems such as IBM's OS/360,
       the object module was then linked together with other object modules
       to form a load module. The load module was the executable code that
       you ran in the computer.</p>

    <p> Modular programming is the concept that similar functions should be contained
        within the same unit of programming code and that separate functions should be
        developed as separate units of code so that the code can easily be maintained
        and reused by different programs. Object-oriented programming is a newer idea
        that inherently encompasses modular programming.</p>

     <p>2) In computer hardware and electronics, a module is a relatively compact
        unit in a larger device or arrangement that is designed to be separately
        installed, replaced, or serviced. For example, a single in-line memory
        module is a unit of random access memory (RAM) that you can add to a personal
        computer.</p>
